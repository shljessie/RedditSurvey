"[""They've been saying superintelligence could arrive this decade for a while actually, at least back since their paper on superintelligence governance.\r\n\r\nEdit cause I want to throw in my opinion as well: I don't think you should read too much into OAI's statements for vague timeline hints. By their own admission if you read their other publications, there is too much uncertainty regarding how the future of the tech plays out. Just as they haven't ruled out unpredictable and major roadblocks, they haven't ruled out the opposite. To me it seems clear their alignment timelines aren't really a good indicator of when the tech will be out, but more of how much work there is to do to for alignment work in general. Remember, before now, alignment was a purely theoretical field with no paradigm and no way to test hypotheses. Now that OAI has the actual AIs, they can finally test 2 decades worth of alignment models and ideas, and they gave themselves 4 years to do it and find or create the best model. They explained clearly in a note that they decided to focus on superintelligence because it's the theoretically hardest one, and solving its alignment retroactively solves those of AGI."", 'Imagine your dog trying to align you.

They have the ability to generate well-written copies, stories, essays, and programs. LLM also acts as a problem solver.\r\n\r\nIn this system, there are several important components:\r\n\r\n1. Planning: The agent can break down big tasks into smaller, manageable goals, making it easier to handle complex tasks.\r\n\r\n2. Reflection and refinement: The agent can analyze its past actions, learn from mistakes, and improve for future steps, making the final results better.\r\n\r\n3. Memory: The agent has both short-term and long-term memory. The short-term memory helps the agent learn in-context, while the long-term memory enables it to store and recall unlimited information over long periods, possibly using an external source.\r\n\r\n4. Tool use: The agent can access external information through APIs (application programming interfaces) to supplement the knowledge it learned from pre-training. This can include current information, executing code, accessing proprietary data, and more.""]","{'comment': ""Probably JavaScript/being in another industry and going to a startup as a junior.
