No shit,4
Out of curiosity how did this company find you,5
"AI is not motivated by things like money, popularity, and social constructs that motivate humans, so I agree that fully functional AI robots would run the world better.",4
"True. I think the JavaScript and the fact it uses deep learning is what gets me. However I interviewed with a finance company that said this and the business logic was switch cases in XML (honestly I wondered under my breath if a SQL db might have been better but who knows). I keep telling myself they reached out to me. Also I do want to make sure I make at least as much as my current job, taking into account I will be learning new things",5
"in what way does essentially saying ""we have to learn how to control this because it could be very dangerous"" help them on a business level? If anything, it's the exact opposite. What you are claiming literally makes no sense",4
"Please, point out to me where I or anyone else said that LLM are AGI. I'll wait. We know what LLMs are, I don't understand why people like you constantly feel the need to post this same exact comment on any sort of discourse that happens around AI. We all know what LLMs are. No shit they aren't AGI.",5
"well seeing how we can’t seem to fix even our most simple problems because majority of our politicians are either idiots or crooked, id love to give an AI ran government a shot",4

"Bing chat:

“Wait, what? They’re doing what?”",5
There are a lot of job scams out there so make sure it is legit. Be wary if they ask you to front any expenses or send them money which would be a huge red flag. Good luck!,4
Over my dead body will a fucking robot rule over me.,5
Well I did look it up via one of it's funders and has contracts through a government agency. If this goes well I will expound on it a bit more. I appreciate it.,4

Probably JavaScript/being in another industry and going to a startup as a junior. In fairness I posted this in a thread and they reached out to me. Also they are well funded and my tech friend said go for it. I just don't want to fuck up as my degree is in business,4
That's completely false you don't know that they could of refined them in a universe without transistors. As for AGI using LLMs I argue with enough memory for long term planning and multi modality it will achieve AGI. Multi modality is more then just image data imagine an LLM that can understand audio video and images hell even gesture and motion data. It will literally be like giving an LLM 5 senses and it already has function calls to use tools so it has arms in a way. It just doesn't have legs or a body unless its embodied in a robotic avatar. Hell it's even possible if they took the text modality to it's absolute limit they could achieve AGI that way so there's multiple paths to AGI it's not just one single path. Multi modality would just be the easiest fastest option. Helen Keller was blind and deaf so all she had to work with was touch smell and taste and she mostly used touch with braille to figure things out about the world.,5

"Excellent analysis. 20% of their compute is a lot. So is devoting their top scientist to this task of solving alignment. If they didn't see AGI and ASI coming so soon I doubt they would be spending so much of their resources in so short of time frame.

One question though is whether Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple will follow their lead here? Is OpenAI the only player acting responsibly? If the others earn a reputation for being reckless they may pay a price.",4
"They stand to materially benefit from more AI hype precisely because they are the industry leader. That's why I'd never trust any timeline they publish, they have a financial incentive to exaggerate.",5
"It depends on the GPO Graduate Program Officer. Most US institutions offer conditional offer letters, only after submitting the certificates you will be able to register for courses. But I may be wrong.",5
All hail our robot overlords!,5

"Without human emotional biases? Odd when I talk to ChatGPT it’s berating me and sounds like a SJW gone wild.
