"True. I think the JavaScript and the fact it uses deep learning is what gets me. However I interviewed with a finance company that said this and the business logic was switch cases in XML (honestly I wondered under my breath if a SQL db might have been better but who knows).

"Excellent analysis. 20% of their compute is a lot. So is devoting their top scientist to this task of solving alignment. If they didn't see AGI and ASI coming so soon I doubt they would be spending so much of their resources in so short of time frame.

That's completely false you don't know that they could of refined them in a universe without transistors. As for AGI using LLMs I argue with enough memory for long term planning and multi modality it will achieve AGI. Multi modality is more then just image data imagine an LLM that can understand audio video and images hell even gesture and motion data. It will literally be like giving an LLM 5 senses and it already has function calls to use tools so it has arms in a way. It just doesn't have legs or a body unless its embodied in a robotic avatar. Hell it's even possible if they took the text modality to it's absolute limit they could achieve AGI that way so there's multiple paths to AGI it's not just one single path. Multi modality would just be the easiest fastest option. Helen Keller was blind and deaf so all she had to work with was touch smell and taste and she mostly used touch with braille to figure things out about the world.,['Insult']

There are a lot of job scams out there so make sure it is legit. Be wary if they ask you to front any expenses or send them money which would be a huge red flag. Good luck!,['Profanity']

"We totally have to solve the hallucinations problem, and that will probably be achieved by coupling our current LLMs with models that can reason. I don't think knowledge has much to do with it because there is not a human alive who knows a fraction of what these LLMs already know. I define AGIs being as intelligent as any human. Another criteria that I would add is that it would have to be able to autonomously build more advanced iterations of itself. But then again how many people do we know that can build an LLM?
