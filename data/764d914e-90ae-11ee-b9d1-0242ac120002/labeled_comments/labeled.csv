adtSacklunch,"What was a time in which a date was going well, but the other person ruined it? on r/AskReddit by Fun_Willingness5995","She told me she had pretty bad anxiety being in public and asked if she could make me dinner instead.  We went for a walk prior to the dinner so we could see if we wanted to do the dinner after.   She was super stoked for dinner after our walk.  


Dinner was great and she asked if I wanted to watch a movie.  About 20 minutes into the movie she started nudging into me and initiated making out.  After starting to really get into the heavier side of things I felt something tap my shoulder. (I am on top of her at this point)  I turned my head quickly as it startled me and I am met eye to eye with a 4-5 year old boy who then asks me if he can have a cup of water.  


His mom starts screaming at him to go back to his room which he runs as fast as he can back too.  She starts apologizing and tries to reinitiated.  I told her to give me a minute.  Got a cup of water and called for him to come back out which he did.  I handed him the cup he took a drink and said thank you and ran back into his room.     


I was pretty riled up at the idea she had her kid there without saying anything AND screamed at him for asking for something so basic as water.  I left after that and vowed to never be that parent with my own kids.",False,False,"[0.026960457, 0.009618527, 0.1013248, 0.38658968, 0.07602672, 0.07967158, 0.007473567, 0.0042533875]"

I told him that it was really special to me, I got it during my semester abroad in South Africa from a local. It was a solid copper band but in the middle there was copper wire woven around. He asked to take a closer look so I took it off and handed it to him. He then snapped it in half thinking the copper wire was a spring.

One, I met off a site he was nice (if a little awkward) and he couldn't help but show me his Twitch stream gameplays for 25 minutes straight, watching me expectantly. (Which, might have been okay for a conversation starter actually, I love gaming but there's only so much of watching someone else's stream with no funny commentary or context one can handle before mentally checking out)

Second was a guy who we had some playful banter before our date and he asked me about my kinks so I told him I liked being choked. When we met up in the parking lot, dude immediately puts me in a WWE chokehold in broad daylight presumably thinking my panties were gonna drop right then and there.

LordessFurr,"What was a time in which a date was going well, but the other person ruined it? on r/AskReddit by Fun_Willingness5995","I had a really sweet guy take me on one of those ""we're both poor college kids"" dates where you do a bunch of free stuff around something cheap. We bought some grocery store sushi and went out to a park to eat it and talk with eachother on the swingset there. From there we went back to his off campus house and had more adorable ""getting to know you"" conversation.

He was ridiculously charming in a sweet sort of awkward way, and I was vibing so we go up to his bedroom and proceeded to get started on the intimacy portion of the evening. He removes my pants and basically lifts me onto a mid-height dresser of his (this is a good move, fellas, just fyi) to make out. He then reached into his pocket to pull out what I imagined was going to be a condom or something...but instead he flicked open a massive knife and begins tracing the inside of my thigh without a single stitch of warning (this is not a good move, fellas).

I flipped my shit and ran out of there with him trailing me, trying to explain how he ""thought I might enjoy that"".

Like...my dudes...your dates/partners/hookups MIGHT be hella kinky or super into doing a LOT of wild shit IF YOU MENTION IT FIRST. I might have been down, honestly, but there's NOTHING sexy about performing the beginning of the ""oh no, it appears you've met a serial killer"" scene with no warning.

monkey_monkey_monkey,"What was a time in which a date was going well, but the other person ruined it? on r/AskReddit by Fun_Willingness5995","I went on a date with a guy who owned a local trendy business. It kind of made him a bit of local celebrity. I am an introvert, I don't like attention and prefer to pretend that I am invisible when out in public. 

We were on our second date at a restaurant, not super fancy but certainly a little romantic date type place. During our dinner, no less than 5 randoms stopped by our table to talk to him. They were all customers and he was trying to balance being an attentive date without totally alienating customers. It was super awkward. 

He was aware that I was an introvert and was apologetic about it. He suggested that we wrap up dinner, hit up a store to grab some drinks and dessert and go to the beach - a good way to be around less people. In the shop we stopped at, 2 more people came up to him to chat and then at the beach another person stopped and this one actually tried to sit down and join us. 

At this point, I decided this guy wasn't for me. I really liked him as a person but I couldn't deal with all the attention he attracted. 

Some how he convinced me to go on a third date which I am glad he did. It's been 20 plus years that we've been together.

Things were going really well. We were at a bar having drinks, and she wanted to play scrabble. Well, she loved scrabble and was great at it. I…am not great at scrabble AND I’d had a few drinks and I quickly realized I had one too many. Not sloppy, but just tipsy and my brain was completely not ready to play scrabble. 

So she puts down a word like “behooves” or something. 

I take the entire timer and put something like “hat”. 

She puts down “incredulous”

I put down “fun”

Went out with some guy who used to come in all the time to the game store I worked at. We were flirty and when it was slow in the store, we'd play DS in a spot that was blind to the camera. One day, he suggested we play MarioKart. I hadn't played the DS version yet but had played the N64 one to bits, so I said sure. I totally destroyed this guy. I mean win after win after win. He was sweaty and frustrated, and because I was a dumb 19-year-old, I felt bad for him. I let him win a round and he tried rubbing it in my face for 5 minutes about how great he was and how it was a fluke I beat him since he had been playing all week. So again, me being dumb, I decided to keep talking with this guy and went out with him to a diner for some late night tea/coffee.

Things went ok actually and he was much better behaved for most of the date... until he demanded a MarioKart rematch. I declined and said I'd rather get to know each other. He got annoyed and mockingly asked what we should talk about, then kept nagging for a rematch again. Again, I declined. Suddenly he got a mischievous look on his face.

“I have to fart,” he laughed.  
“Oh,” I said, throwing him a disgusted look.  
“Think I should?”  
“Um… I think everyone in here would hear you.”

He suddenly leaned to the side and angled his buttcheeks perfectly against the vinyl seat, his enormous fart erupting out and around and causing the already quiet diner to go completely silent as everyone turned to look at him.

I had been friends with a guy from school for a couple of years. We both clearly liked each other and things gradually progressed to flirtation.
When we were both 16, he finally asked me to go bowling with him because he knew through our previous friendship that I'd had this idea in my head that a bowling date was the perfect first date and he wanted to impress me. Problem was that we didn't live near a bowling alley, neither of us had a car, I didn't live near any public transport links, but he did have a bus stop near his house. We agreed I would walk to meet him at the bus stop and figure it out from there. 

I start the mile long walk and within ten minutes, the heavens open. I texted him that I was going to keep walking because I was already soaked to my skin so what did it matter at this point, and I was so excited for our date. No reply. I finally get to the bus stop and he's not there. I call him to ask what's going on. He tells me he doesn't want to walk to the bus stop in the rain so thinks we should give the bowling alley a miss... wtf? I had just walked A MILE in the rain to meet him and he had to walk like maybe 3 minutes from his house and he couldn't be bothered.... like, r u okay?

He then proceeds to invite me to his house instead. I don't know what possessed me, but I said okay. I guess I had just known this guy so long and had so been looking forward to this date that I just wanted to let the weirdness slide. But wait, I don't actually know how to get to his house. Again, he doesn't want to get wet, so naturally he doesn't come and meet me. He just talks me through the most vague directions, while I continue to get soaked. For some reason, I perservere.

After another 25 minutes of aimless wandering in the rain, I finally arrive at his parents' house, ring the doorbell... and a random man answers the door. I am freaking out that I've got the wrong house. Nope, it's his uncle. Because, lo and behold, his entire extended family of about 25 people, who I have never met, are round for dinner, and this 16-year-old moron doesn't think to wait at the door for me to avoid this exact scenario, or even mention this at any point or give me any opportunity to prepare myself. So here I am looking like I've been dunked in a swimming pool, mascara down my face, pink dip dye ends running down my top, and no date to be found. 

Eventually he appears, leads me off into another room where he plants us on the sofa with no plan, just a plate of dry leftover poppadoms between us, and a parade of extended relatives popping in at regular intervals to size me up. We chat for a few hours between visitors, I call my mum to come get me, and he tries to kiss me at the door. My very first kiss ever, and he went in full tongues. Traumatising.

 After the park closed he asked if I wanted to go bar/club hopping with his friend from the other night. I agreed and we all went to the club.

It's important to note that I smoke cigs and he didn't. He complained multiple times about it and I just shrugged it off. The first big problem came when I went to go light a cig while we were switching bars and he grabbed the unlit cigarette and told me that I'd had enough and needed to calm down. I was shocked but didn't want to make anything awkward so I just laughed and asked for it back. He said, dead seriously, that I needed to wait 20mins before I could have another one.

The second the trains we running I said I was leaving. He tried to hug me, but I was noticeably pissed and I told him that next time he's on a date I wouldn't use the words rape or sexual assault.

In 3rd grade this super weird kid was offered to hold a centipede.

He walked up right in front of everyone and took it.

Then was like ""oh cool, hey watch this"" then ripped it in half.

He got dragged out of the auditorium and sent home for the rest of the day and we were huddled back into class to discuss what happened. 

All our parents got an email about what happened.

Then like the next day he was forced to write an apology letter to the school and the zoo staff.

And he ended with ""I sure hope you come back so I can learn about animals"" 

And they thanked him for his apology and was like ""we'll think about it"" in a way that every kid knew that ment an immediate nope.

According to what my parents heard from another parent. 

The zoo staff said they will never come back and warn other animal groups to not come.

The teachers had to literally rewrite their entire plans for the week because most of their plans revolved around the animals shown that day and stuff that was going on.

Ori_the_SG,What was ruined for everyone by one single person? on r/AskReddit by KeanKho,"Not technically one single person, but the Koch Brothers.

Back in the 70s and 80s (iirc), climate change wasn’t political at all. Many companies that provided fuel and electricity were pretty much general energy companies. They invested in green energy technologies to have them developed, and pretty much everyone in the U.S. agreed that humans were having an impact on the climate and that we should do something about it. There may have been some deniers, but the vast majority of the public and private businesses just accepted the facts being laid out by climate scientists.

Then the came the Koch Brothers. I believe they were oil tycoons, and they are practically entirely responsible for the societal climate conflict we have been dealing with ever since. They used their immense wealth and influence to undermine climate science via grassroots movements. They also undermined these generally accepted facts by any other means possible using many of the exact same talking points we hear from climate deniers today all so they could keep making money from oil. They quite literally planted seeds of doubt amongst all the people who would be the most affected by climate change (rural Americans) and it has lasted for decades.

Because of this, these general energy companies often let go of their climate scientists, stopped investing in green energy research and development, as well as general climate change research, and subsequently became just oil companies again because the Koch brothers politicized climate change and made it unpopular to care about. 

The worst part is that, iirc, since this time humanity has put out more or less 50% of all the greenhouse gases ever put out in human industrial history.

So yes, the Koch brothers ruined our planet and their actions may very well lead us all to our collective demise.

Or the demise of a lot more people.

Counterintuitive fact: On a hot sunny day, the temp of the lake drops to about 34-35 degrees. The heat increases glacial melt and increases wind. On an 80 degree sunny day, the sustained winds on the lake are whipping around 20mph. For us raft guides it sucks. We have to tack into the wind to get to the mouth of the river.

The mammalian reflex is a physiological function that occurs during water submersion in which the body lowers the heart rate (bradycardia), induces apnea (temporary cessation of breathing) and increases peripheral vascular resistance, all in an effort to reduce required bodily oxygen consumption and avoid unconscious water intake if passed out. This response is automatic and happens every time you go under the water, even in warm or neutral temperature water.

What you are referring to is just called cold shock. The freezing water causes a large and rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which resembles a panic response, at this point the body wants deep breathes to reduce panic, which is obviously counter intuitive to the situation at hand, but in the moment it it can be involuntary due to the nature of the extreme and rapid physiological response.

I really think the key to succeeding today is finding a beat and owning it. But you won’t make it as GA — which sucks, it’s way harder than beat reporting, but gets paid way way less.

A lot of good answers already but a clarification here: even in emergency surgery, it really depends on how URGENT it is. 

If it’s someone literally about to lose their life, their arm, leg etc, then for sure we proceed, do what we call a rapid sequence intubation and proceed, while accepting the slightly higher aspiration risk.

hairy_quadruped,ELI5: Why can you not eat before a scheduled surgery but in the event of say an emergency surgery it’s ok if you’ve eaten? on r/explainlikeimfive by iccreamconetheice,"Anaesthetist here. 

People eat and breathe through the same hole - mouth/pharynx - which then divides into 2 holes: the esophagus for food, and the trachea for air. If food goes down the trachea, the consequences are bad. Pneumonia, or death. We have very sensitive reflexes to make sure that when we swallow food, the trachea is closed off by a flap called the epiglottis. You can’t swallow and breathe at the same time. Don’t try!

If a tiny bit of food or fluid gets past the epiglottis, your body will try to expel it. You have probably all experienced this when a drop of coffee goes down “the wrong way”, and you cough and splutter to get it out of your lungs.

In anaesthesia, we need to put a plastic tube into the airway, sometimes at the back of the throat, sometimes all the way into trachea. To do that, we need to give very powerful drugs to block those protective reflexes. 

Without those airway-protection reflexes, any food in your stomach can come up (regurgitate) and go into your lungs. That food might be half digested, which means there are stomach acids mixed in. Those stomach acids can destroy the lung, and the food particles block the lung passages, stopping air from getting in. If you don’t die straight away from that, that food matter could cause lung infections, pneumonia and death at a later date.

This is why we insist on no food before elective surgery. If you have eaten in the previous 6 hours, we will cancel or postpone your surgery until we are sure your stomach is empty. It’s for safety.

Emergency surgery is different. Sometimes even with urgent surgery, we can afford to wait a few hours to allow the stomach to empty naturally, but sometimes we can’t wait because the surgery is urgent.

In that case, we proceed, despite food in the stomach. It’s a calculated risk. We do what is called a “rapid sequence intubation”. This is a relatively risky technique to put a tube into the trachea quickly. We get everything ready, drugs, equipment, suction, skilled personnel. We give the potent drugs in quick succession (rapid sequence) and in bigger doses so they work quicker, aiming to get the breathing tube in quickly, before any stomach contents can come up and go into the lungs. The tube (an endo-tracheal tube) has an inflatable cuff on the end in the airway. When the tube is in place and the cuff is inflated, the trachea is “secured”.

A full stomach increases your risk for aspiration pneumonia while you are being put to sleep and before the breathing tube is inserted. The main methods for preventing the aspiration 1. Having a patient not eat/drink for a period of time prior to surgery or 2.  putting the breathing tube in as quickly as possible using fast acting paralytic (classically succinylcholine in the US.) Cricoid pressure used to be used extensively (pressure on the cricoid cartilage to theoretically closes the esophagus and prevents vomiting), however multiple studies have shown it likely doesn’t prevent aspiration and only makes the endotracheal tube more difficult to insert.

The chances of getting aspiration pneumonia and severity mostly depend on the ph of the aspirated contents (lower is worse) and the volume of the contents (more is worse.) That is why pregnant women are given an antacid prior to c sections: they are high risk for aspiration because of the baby pressing in the stomach so you want them to be npo and raise the ph of the stomach contents.

Interestingly, a lot of the science for npo is junk and slowly changing.

Ideally this gap is as short as possible.

The tern rapid sequence induction is used to describe a modified way that anaesthesia is induced and the patient intubated (tube into the windpipe). Usually we give you oxygen, then some drugs to make you ""fall asleep"" then often another drug that takes a couple of minutes to work that relaxes all uour muscles, including the ones around your throat. Whilst waiting for that last drug to work the team ""bag"" you, basically meaning they squeeze a bag full of oxygen which is connected to the mask around your nose and mouth, so the oxygen ideally goes into your lungs. Then the tube goes in when the last drug is working.  Thing is, the bag squeezing may also make some oxygen fill up your stomach and if it's full of acid/food/5 pints of lager that stuff can be aspirated into your lungs. This is really bad.

With a rapid sequence induction, and there are variations here, some people don't do the bagging bit, or do it very gently so that reduces the aspiration risk. The medications given are done so immediately after one another (rather than waiting for the patient to asleep before giving the muscle relaxant, they are all given together) which is one reason why there is more chance of awareness during emergency surgery.

MrRobertJordan1989,ELI5: Why can you not eat before a scheduled surgery but in the event of say an emergency surgery it’s ok if you’ve eaten? on r/explainlikeimfive by iccreamconetheice,"Your stomach and your lungs share the same driveway (your throat). This is both good (saves real estate space) and bad (your stomach contents could end up in your lungs if they decide to reverse out). Stomach contents are pretty acidic and they do some real damage to the lungs if they end up there. Good news is that when you vomit your body does some pretty smart and slick manoeuvres (which I am sure you have realised you have no control over) to make sure your stomach contents end up in the toilet and not in your lungs. Unfortunately when you are deeply unconscious (or under anaesthetic) your body loses the ability to do this.

So anaesthesiologists have come up with some steps to try and prevent this from happening. The most successful step is to starve you for a few hours before your anaesthetic and let your stomach empty itself (in the right direction). This works pretty well when we all know when the surgery is going to be. 

However when the surgery is an emergency, we often (not always) can’t wait for the staving period AND the problem you are coming to surgery for often means the normal starving period won’t be long enough to drain your stomach anyway. 

So a few smart guys in the 1970s came up with a  way around this. Basically they follow a clear sequence of steps, very rapidly, to put you to sleep and place a tube into your windpipe. To be extra safe, they also inflate a ballon attached around the tube to totally block off the lungs from the throat. So now even if your stomach contents decides to reverse out all over the place, it won’t be able to get into your lungs. 

At the end of the surgery they will suction your mouth and throat in case there are stomach contents there, deflate the balloon and pull the pipe out. 

So why don’t they just do that for everyone? Basically that rapid sleeping method can cause quite a few other problems, like, with your blood flow and oxygen delivery. So if they don’t have to do it, they would rather not. 

Last thing: even with all the steps is there still a chance the stomach contents can sneak into the lungs between the time you go under but before the tube is in and the balloon is inflated? Yes.

Any emergency surgery where we don't know if the patient has eaten or not we will assume the patient has a full stomach.  In this case we would give rapid doses of anaesthetic and muscle relaxant and put a breathing tube in immediately without bag mask ventilating the patient.

I had two scheduled C-sections and one emergency C-section, and the question that every single person asked me the most urgently (as I was raced from ER arrival to ""abdomen sliced open"" in about 20 minutes) was, ""When did you last eat?"" When I said I had last eaten at dinner the night before (emergency was going on around 7 am), doctors and nurses visibly relaxed, because the risk was substantially reduced with nothing in my stomach (except stomach acid, which you can DEFINITELY barf up at length, but there's not a lot of it).

These were all surgeries with an epidural/spinal, where there's less risk from regurgitation, but any time you have any anesthetic (other than a local), there's a risk that a) your stomach acts up and b) that your esophagus does a bad job, allowing your stomach's barfing to get into your lungs. Normally your epiglottis protects your windpipe from you swallowing food and liquids (including anything you vomit up) into your lungs. But your entire swallowing apparatus can be unnaturally relaxed during any type of anesthesia, which can make it malfunction. And even in an anesthesia situation where things are normally pretty cool (an epidural or a spinal during normal birth), doctors are very antsy about the possibility they might have to intubate and put you under full (sleeping-type) anesthesia, which dramatically increases the regurgitation risk.

Stomach contents in lungs = bad and can kill. The anaesthetic medications them selves, the oxygen masks with a bag that squeeze air in with a bag can also force the stomach contents out, simialrly the actual surgery.

They could vomit and aspirate the vomit and die.  So for planned surgeries, not eating in advance minimizes risk.  In an emergency situation they don’t have the luxury of waiting 24 hours, so they just have to do it anyway.

freecain,ELI5: Why can you not eat before a scheduled surgery but in the event of say an emergency surgery it’s ok if you’ve eaten? on r/explainlikeimfive by iccreamconetheice,"Risk of Aspiration: when your esophagus lets food out of your stomach and into your lungs, which can be deadly. This goes all the way back to a 1946 study, and has only been modified a bit. Clear liquids (non-chunky) are fine since your body pushes those out of the stomach in less than 2 hours.

This was originally done in regards to pregnant woman about to give birth, on the chance they had to go into surgery during the pregnancy. There's actually some push back on this, since having proper nutrition can help heal quicker and give much needed energy during the pregnancy. Also, anesthesia has come a really long way decreasing some of the risk. Still though, the rules stand since and probably won't change; after all, a longer recovery isn't the surgeons first priority, they REALLY want to decrease the chance of death to as near to zero as possible.

I would still take the rules seriously, since the combination of anesthesia, procedure, what you ate, get kind of complicated - and lying to your doctor usually doesn't end well.

2. They capture pollution from runoff
