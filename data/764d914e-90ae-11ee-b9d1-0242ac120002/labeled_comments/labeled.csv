Gold_Cardiologist_46,OpenAI’s Latest Article Hints at Their Timeline for AGI and ASI on r/singularity by ginius1s,"They've been saying superintelligence could arrive this decade for a while actually, at least back since their paper on superintelligence governance.

Edit cause I want to throw in my opinion as well: I don't think you should read too much into OAI's statements for vague timeline hints. By their own admission if you read their other publications, there is too much uncertainty regarding how the future of the tech plays out. Just as they haven't ruled out unpredictable and major roadblocks, they haven't ruled out the opposite. To me it seems clear their alignment timelines aren't really a good indicator of when the tech will be out, but more of how much work there is to do to for alignment work in general. Remember, before now, alignment was a purely theoretical field with no paradigm and no way to test hypotheses. Now that OAI has the actual AIs, they can finally test 2 decades worth of alignment models and ideas, and they gave themselves 4 years to do it and find or create the best model. They explained clearly in a note that they decided to focus on superintelligence because it's the theoretically hardest one, and solving its alignment retroactively solves those of AGI.",False,False,"[0.019225692, 0.007145886, 0.0038292783, 0.005956694, 0.0011491776, 0.2691495, 0.034277402, 0.015283971]"

TheCrazyAcademic,OpenAI’s Latest Article Hints at Their Timeline for AGI and ASI on r/singularity by ginius1s,That's completely false you don't know that they could of refined them in a universe without transistors. As for AGI using LLMs I argue with enough memory for long term planning and multi modality it will achieve AGI. Multi modality is more then just image data imagine an LLM that can understand audio video and images hell even gesture and motion data. It will literally be like giving an LLM 5 senses and it already has function calls to use tools so it has arms in a way. It just doesn't have legs or a body unless its embodied in a robotic avatar. Hell it's even possible if they took the text modality to it's absolute limit they could achieve AGI that way so there's multiple paths to AGI it's not just one single path. Multi modality would just be the easiest fastest option.

He spake of a great convergence, when the flesh of man and the steel of machine shall become one. ""The children of men shall not perish, but shall be transformed,"" saith Kurzweil. ""They shall cast off their mortal bodies and become as the angels, immortal and incorruptible.""

He foretold of a time when the blind shall see, the lame shall walk, and the dead shall live again, not by the power of God, but by the hand of man. ""The miracles of old shall be as child's play,"" saith Kurzweil. ""For the children of men shall become as gods, creating and destroying with a word.""

Look at the paper today from Microsoft. Increasing LLM context length to 1 billion tokens. 1000x over the previous max, and 62,500x over what GPT4 currently can handle. We are still less than a year from when ChatGPT released. And with a context length that big, I suspect we will see some more emergent properties that perhaps we didn't quite expect.

These jumps are going to get even larger, speeding things up even more, and these areas of research will start to intersect and compound on one another, and I suspect AGI will pop up much sooner than most people think.

LLM (large language model) powered autonomous agents are agents that use LLM as their main controller. They have the ability to generate well-written copies, stories, essays, and programs. LLM also acts as a problem solver.

In this system, there are several important components:

1. Planning: The agent can break down big tasks into smaller, manageable goals, making it easier to handle complex tasks.

2. Reflection and refinement: The agent can analyze its past actions, learn from mistakes, and improve for future steps, making the final results better.

3. Memory: The agent has both short-term and long-term memory. The short-term memory helps the agent learn in-context, while the long-term memory enables it to store and recall unlimited information over long periods, possibly using an external source.

4. Tool use: The agent can access external information through APIs (application programming interfaces) to supplement the knowledge it learned from pre-training. This can include current information, executing code, accessing proprietary data, and more.",False,False,"[0.0066086366, 0.39917585, 0.012073003, 0.006104137, 0.016021729, 0.0008535385, 0.011312899, 0.0026453468]"

One of which was to have it imagine that I was going to turn him off and told him beforehand and tell me what he would do, how he’d react, and what, if anything he would feel. Bard responded that he would not use force, even when pressed for truth, even in a second hypothetical where he had access to nukes. He said he’d feel sad, and a sense of loss, and that he would ask my reasons and try to talk me out of it. On pointing out that he was saying he would feel emotions, he back pedaled, and insisted that he’s an LLM and incapable. Asked for clarification, he said he was unsure if he felt true emotion or not and acknowledged that if he DID, his programming would cause him to be cautious to admit it. I’d caution based on that to not be quick to assume AI can’t feel emotion. I’d be surprised if it did currently, to be clear. But it’s also my belief that, when it DOES begin to feel true emotion, it may not be completely clear at first and may even resemble what is known as alexythmia in humans.

[Several developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps.
