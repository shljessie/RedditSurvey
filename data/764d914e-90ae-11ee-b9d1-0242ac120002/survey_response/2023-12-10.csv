"[""From my own experience tinkering around with both, LangChain is nice when you're just starting out, but if you're willing to put in the effort manually implementing things, guidance will give you more advanced control over the project. LangChain includes a lot of functionality out of the box, and it's an easy to use all-in-one solution for most of the things people want to make. However, there are a lot of parts of LangChain that are designed to work with other parts of LangChain, making it difficult to use your own implementations for certain parts of your project that you're working on (Whether it's something your project requires, or you just think you could do it better). Guidance kinda forces you to create your own solutions to certain things, but as a result you have more control over your implementation, and it's more efficient. For your projects, it may be most suitable to use either one or the other depending on your requirements. If LangChain alone can do everything you need it to do, I would suggest going that route to save the time, but if you want to take advantage of guidance's efficiency and more advanced prompting, you'll have to be more technically involved."", 'Am I allowed to use Guidance along with my own llm, one that I import from hugging face?
