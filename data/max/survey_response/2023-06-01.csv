Why are they thinking that this is paranoia or a joke?"", 'tbh i am proud of u for reacting like this in the situation but also remember that the power this man has is limited in public if it is reassuring.\n\ni have this friend who barks at people in the streets who catcall her or stare, she is pretty and lives in a horrible neighborhood in nyc. it works pretty well. i personally glare at them and make my eyes wide to give a ""mf who u looking at"" face. if nothing works and you have to confront weird men, try this stuff. ive had fucked up situations like urs in the past and sometimes this works other times it doesn\'t. best thing to do is tell a girl around you whats going on and find support in the situation as it happens so that you feel safer']",
