"Just a heads up, but being in a public place where you can ask any of the workers for help/to call the police or asking for the stalker to be escorted out of the cafe is much better than alone in the neighborhood running. Additionally, do not be afraid to phone the police, as well as let the stalker know that too, and try to catch the license plate as well. Glad you are okay!",False,False
"I would advise you to report to CUPD.  Yes, they may think you are overreacting but it is always good to build a paper trail of records against any potential stalker",False,False
"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you! This is terrifying! 
I went through a targeted attack recently, white male, grey hair, possibly 50s-60s age range, in a black car. This happened at night when I was walking on Lake Ave (a couple blocks north from Gimme Coffee). I had stopped at the crossing when I saw a black car approaching. He stopped as well. I paused to see if he wanted to turn, he didn‚Äôt so I started crossing the road. Half way through he came at me. I jumped back, he braked, glared at me and sped away. I was SO scared I ran from there cause I was terrified that he‚Äôd turn the block and come back. I couldn‚Äôt even see the plates because it happened so fast and it was a literal ‚Äúdeer caught in the headlights moment‚Äù at the time. I cried all the way home because this has never happened to me and I felt so scared and sad. I‚Äôm an international student and I don‚Äôt know if it was racial but I‚Äôve been terrified to walk on the streets and cross roads ever since. Every time I see a black car my heart just beats so fast and I relive that entire experience. Why did he have to be so cruel and do that? I feel so sad, angry and scared nowadays.",False,False

Please report this to campus police and Ithaca police  This way the police can be on the lookout for him and make public aware.,False,False
That's awful! I'm glad you're safe,True,False
was he bald by any chance? I had a weird experience 2 years ago,False,False
Pepper spray should be used first to keep distance. The taser is for the warning,False,False
"Agree that you should report it, and I'm sorry this happened to you

Always carry a weapon, even if ur on campus. I know it's hard to find weapons that are allowed in dorms, but anything is better than nothing. Sharp keychain (kubotan), rape whistle/alarm to scare someone off, even if you carry a butter knife in your purse, have something.",False,False

"tbh i am proud of u for reacting like this in the situation but also remember that the power this man has is limited in public if it is reassuring.

i have this friend who barks at people in the streets who catcall her or stare, she is pretty and lives in a horrible neighborhood in nyc. it works pretty well. i personally glare at them and make my eyes wide to give a ""mf who u looking at"" face. if nothing works and you have to confront weird men, try this stuff. ive had fucked up situations like urs in the past and sometimes this works other times it doesn't. best thing to do is tell a girl around you whats going on and find support in the situation as it happens so that you feel safer",False,False

The people who work at the Gimme OP is talking about are all extremely nice and I‚Äôm very sure would do whatever they could to help. Even just typing a quick note on ur phone and subtly turning it their direction when you‚Äôre paying. They‚Äôd know what to do.,False,False
"Thanks for the advice, definitely should‚Äôve taken a different approach. In the moment, I was considering asking the workers for help or anyone nearby but the cafe is extremely small and he was basically at the entrance since the line was almost out the door. I didn‚Äôt want to be within a few feet near him because I didn‚Äôt want to have any interaction with him. He wasn‚Äôt afraid of following me in broad daylight with people and children walking near me so I was scared what he might say or do if he had the chance to do so. I was also scared he would just wait outside and follow me after and I was trying to think quickly.",False,False
"Definitely report to CUPD. Last year, the same thing happened to a friend of mine in the same area, but the guy was driving a different colored car. She reported to CUPD and Ithaca PD.",True,False

"Humans evolved paranoia for a REASON. It is a far better to mistake a stick for a snake, and move away from it, than to mistake a snake for a stick and step on it. Similarly here, the negative consequences of being WRONG about a stalker results in her potentially dying, i.e. extremely bad consequence. Whereas if this just happens to be an unfortunate coincidence than very little harm has been done.",False,False
"No, it's really not.",False,False
Just because you‚Äôre paranoid doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not out to get you,False,False
"Ah yes, a much older person starts tailing you and chasing after you and it's so very obvious just ""paranoia"". Hopefully something bad happens in your life in the future and leaves a lasting impact, making you grow as a person as a result. Get well soon",False,False

"Really? You thought a 60 year old man was creepily following a woman around town to give her back her airpods, which she dropped and he somehow picked up while he was in a vehicle while she was walking, and he never thought to verbally articulate what he was doing? And then he posted about it on reddit? Not saying the commenter is Dave Chapelle but you‚Äôre not exactly Sherlock Holmes either if you didn‚Äôt get that that was a joke.",False,False

Cornell redditors aren't the most adept when it comes to basic social cues and humor.,False,False
Why do you think potential assault or kidnapping is funny?,False,False
"The joke is how absurd his post is, attributing the man's actions, which are clearing menacing, to the simply act of returning earbuds. It's like the guy in the Spongebob chocolate episode who just wants to buy all the chocolate. And obviously that's not the guy, that would be insane.",False,False

You asked how it's funny and I explained the construction of the joke. Humor is subjective.,False,False

"I'm aware of the construction of the ""joke"". I'm just curious why you think those things are funny to joke about.",False,False
"Because assault, kidnapping, and rape is funny to you?",False,True
I didn't make the joke. You and others asked for an explanation and I provided one. Stop being obtuse. No one thinks kidnapping is funny. The joke is the contrast in the emotional tone of the OP and the response. No one claimed it's not in bad taste.,False,False
"No, the absurdity of the thought of a girl running away from a man who was actually trying to help her is funny. You're trying \*really, really\* hard to not understand the joke.",False,False
