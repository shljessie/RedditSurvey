"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you! This is terrifying! 
I went through a targeted attack recently, white male, grey hair, possibly 50s-60s age range, in a black car. This happened at night when I was walking on Lake Ave (a couple blocks north from Gimme Coffee). I had stopped at the crossing when I saw a black car approaching. He stopped as well. I paused to see if he wanted to turn, he didn‚Äôt so I started crossing the road. Half way through he came at me. I jumped back, he braked, glared at me and sped away. I was SO scared I ran from there cause I was terrified that he‚Äôd turn the block and come back. I couldn‚Äôt even see the plates because it happened so fast and it was a literal ‚Äúdeer caught in the headlights moment‚Äù at the time. I cried all the way home because this has never happened to me and I felt so scared and sad. I‚Äôm an international student and I don‚Äôt know if it was racial but I‚Äôve been terrified to walk on the streets and cross roads ever since.
